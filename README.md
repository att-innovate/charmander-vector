![Vector](vector.png)

Vector is an open source on-host performance monitoring framework which exposes hand picked high resolution system and application metrics to every engineer’s browser. Having the right metrics available on-demand and at a high resolution is key to understand how a system behaves and correctly troubleshoot performance issues.

## Disclaimer

This is the first release of Vector. As such, expect to find bugs and issues. We count on your support to find and report them!

Vector is under constant development and new versions should be released often. **Use the stable branch for a stable version**.
